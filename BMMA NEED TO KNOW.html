<title>BMMA NEED TO KNOW</title>

<center><b><h1> BMMA NEED TO KNOW </h1></center>
<center> This website is all about kickboxing/BMMA... If you are looking for tips, want to start, or just want to know stuff, this is the right place to go
<h2><center> Your stances and guards</center></h2>
<center> Your stances and your guards are so important! But if you don't know what they are then that's why I'm here to help.
<h3>Front Stance</h3></b>
When you are fighting or doing syllabus 80% of the time you will be in a front stance, a front stance is a position with your feet (and sometimes changes your guards). First put your feet in a neutral stance and move your back foot (left foot for right stance and right foot for left stance) backwards diagonally, next your guards for a front stance. Firstly position your hands into fists with your thumbs on the outside of the fists and place your back hand (if you are in a left stance that would be your right hand but if you are in a right stance that would be your left hand) on your chin. There you have it, a simple front stance!
<h3><b>Side Stance</b></h3>
When you fight/compete in points sparring you will 99% of the time use a side stance. Sometimes you use it in syllabus too. Side stance is a little less complicated than front stance and my favourite. First, pretend you are riding a skateboard (with your legs) and choose either your left leg infront (left side stance) or you right foot infront (right side stance). Position you hands flat with your thumb tucked in, your front hand should be infront but lower than a front stance guard and your back hand should be laying on your stomach and bend your knees a little bit. There you have it, a side stance!
<h3><b> Bouncing</b></h3>
Bouncing is not what you think it is. Bouncing is where you stand on you tip toes and jump up and down (but only a little bit so your toes dont come of the floor too much). You bounce in stance to help with speed, so side stance you will bounce but in a front stance you do a rocking motion with your knees to help with movement.
<h3><b> What is The Syllabus? </b></h3>
The. Syllabus is an important thing to BMMA. Think of it as a game you have to practice skills to ge better eqiptment but with this you earn a new belt. That sounds silly but it's not the ordering of the belts go like this:
</center><b><ul><li> WHITE </ul></li>
<ul><li> YELLOW </ul></li>
<ul><li>ORANGE</ul></li>
<ul><li>RED</ul></li>
<ul><li>RED-STRIPE</ul></li>
<ul><li>GREEN</ul></li>
<ul><li>GREEN-STRIPE</ul></li>
<ul><li>BLUE</ul></li>
<ul><li>BLUE-STRIPE</ul></li>
<ul><li>PURPLE</ul></li>
<ul><li>PURPLE-STRIPE</ul></li>
<ul><li>BROWN</ul></li>
<ul><li>BROWN-STRIPE</ul></li>
<ul><li>BLACK</ul></li></b>
<center>After that you have something called Black Belt Dans, there are 10.
<h2><b>Sparring</h2>
Sparring is a fun/harder side of BMMA, where everything you learn you use in real/live fighting!
<h3>Equiptment Needed:</b></h3>
My reccomendation for equiptment is to buy <b><u>Top Ten</b></u>:
</center><b><ul><li>Headguard</ul></li>
<ul><li>Kicks</ul></li>
<ul><li>Points Gloves (for beginners)</ul></li>
<ul><li>10 oz Gloves (for more advanced)</ul></li></b>
<center>Then for less important stuff that you still need, buy <b><u>Kicksport</u></b>
</center><b><ul><li>Shin Pads</ul></li>
<ul><li>Gumshield (doesn't really matter if it's kicksport or not)</ul></li></b>
<center><h3>What Are the Main Types You Start With?</h3>
Well, there are many types you can start with depending what type of MMA you start:  
If you are doing Boxing, then you would start with Boxing.
If you are doing Kickboxing then you normally start with Points Sparring. But sometimes you start with Light Con, 
<h3> Points Sparring</h3>
Points sparring is a really fast type of sparring, it's all about who lands the shot first. If you land a shot before the other person then you get a point vice versa. You also use a side stance!
<h3> Light Con</h3> 
Light Con is just confusing and painful. It's about ho is the most aggressive and deals the most damage
<h2> Why Do People Start? </h2>
Most people do it for the Fitness others do it for self defense, health kicks, to impress people, to learn morals and so many more reasons.
<b>But the main reason is <h4>DISCIPLINE</h4></b>
